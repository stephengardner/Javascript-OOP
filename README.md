# Javascript OOP

Creating objects which inherit required functionality for use in real world applications.

## Overlay

A practical overlay object with add/remove methods, useful for a "loading" animation during AJAX calls

## User

A practical User object prototype which can be applied to create other types of users, such as a "User with History".  

### Notes

This is a very simplified skeleton of some concepts I use to build apps.  There's nothing ground breaking here, yet :)
